<h2 id="header1">Chicken</h2>
<p id="article1">Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have become prevalent in numerous cuisines. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[11][12]

Other terms are:

Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
Chick: a young chicken[15]
Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification]

Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands)</p>

<h2 id="header2">Beef </h2><p id="article2">Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product.The word beef is from the Latin word bōs,[1] in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).[2] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to them. This is one example of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, deer/venison, sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon).[3] Beef is cognate with bovine through the Late Latin bovīnus.[4] The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves </p>

<h2 id="header3">Sushi </h2><p id="article3">Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi. The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.[2][3][4].

Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat. </p>
